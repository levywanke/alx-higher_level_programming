## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to explain:
- The advantages of Python programming
- How to perform basic file operations (open, read, write, close)
- File manipulation techniques (line-by-line reading, cursor movement)
- Usage of context management (`with` statement)
- JSON serialization and deserialization in Python
- Conversion between Python data structures and JSON strings

## Copyright - Plagiarism

All code must be original work. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style
- All files must be executable

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should end with a new line
- Tests should be inside a folder named `tests`
- Test files should have the extension `.txt`
- Run tests with `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Documentation required for modules, classes, and functions

## Tasks Covered in This Repository

1. **Read file**: Read a text file and print its contents.
2. **Write to a file**: Write a string to a text file and return the number of characters written.
3. **Append to a file**: Append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.
4. **To JSON string**: Convert Python objects (lists, dictionaries) to JSON strings.
5. **From JSON string to object**: Convert JSON strings back to Python objects.
6. **Save Object to a file**: Write Python objects to a file as JSON.
7. **Create object from a JSON file**: Read JSON data from a file and create Python objects.
8. **Load, add, save**: Add arguments to a Python list and save them to a file as JSON.
9. **Class to JSON**: Convert class instances to JSON-serializable dictionaries.
10. **Student to JSON with filter**: Filter attributes when converting class instances to JSON.
11. **Student to disk and reload**: Save class instances to a JSON file and reload them.
12. **Pascal's Triangle**: Generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.
