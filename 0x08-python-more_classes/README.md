# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of classes and objects, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Each script builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and functionalities.

## Project Details
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Start:** January 4, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** January 5, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** January 4, 2024 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) (Read: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- Class and Instance Attributes
- Classmethods and staticmethods
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- str vs repr

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
- What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
- What is a class attribute
- What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
- What is a class method
- What is a static method
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
The repository includes the following tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of OOP in Python:

1. **Simple rectangle**: Defines a basic rectangle class.
2. **Real definition of a rectangle**: Enhances the rectangle class with width and height properties.
3. **Area and Perimeter**: Adds methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
4. **String representation**: Modifies the class to print the rectangle using `#`.
5. **Eval is magic**: Implements `__repr__` to allow recreating instances using `eval`.
6. **Detect instance deletion**: Prints a message when an instance is deleted.
7. **Change representation**: Adds a class attribute `print_symbol` for customizing the rectangle's string representation.
8. **Compare rectangles**: Implements a static method to compare rectangles based on area.
9. **A square is a rectangle**: Extends the rectangle class to create squares.
