"""Resolves the N-queens conundrum.

Resolves the intricate challenge of positioning N non-attacking queens on an N by N chessboard, uncovering all potential configurations.

Usage:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N

N ought to be an integer no less than 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list structured by sublists, symbolizing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A catalog of lists housing possible solutions.

The solutions are denoted in the following pattern: [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]] where 'r' and 'c' designate the row and column, respectively, for the placement of a queen on the chessboard.
