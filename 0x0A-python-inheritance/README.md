## Description

This project focuses on exploring inheritance in Python, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Through a series of tasks and questions, participants will deepen their understanding of how inheritance works, its applications, and related concepts like superclass, subclass, method overriding, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain the following concepts and demonstrate them in code:
- Why Python programming is advantageous
- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- The default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by inheritance to subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance in Python
- How and when to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

## Tasks Overview

The project includes multiple tasks designed to reinforce understanding of inheritance concepts through practical implementation. Each task corresponds to specific learning objectives and challenges participants to apply their knowledge effectively.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Python 3.8.5 or higher on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Python Test Cases
- **File Endings:** All test files should end with a new line
- **Directory:** Place all test files inside a `tests` folder
- **File Format:** Test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- **Execution Command:** Execute tests using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation:** Ensure all modules, classes, and functions have proper documentation
