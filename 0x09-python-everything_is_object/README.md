## Description

This project explores fundamental concepts of Python programming language, specifically focusing on objects, mutability, immutability, and object referencing. Through a series of tasks and questions, the project aims to deepen understanding of these core principles which are crucial for Python developers.

---

## Background Context

In Python, "everything is an object" means that every entity, such as variables, functions, and data structures, are treated as objects with their own properties and methods. Understanding how Python handles different types of objects—mutable and immutable—is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

---

## Tasks Overview

The tasks in this project cover various scenarios to test and reinforce understanding of Python's object-oriented behavior. These include questions on object identity (`is`), object equality (`==`), mutability, and how variables reference objects.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 or higher
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a newline character
- Use of pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style adherence
- All scripts must be executable

## Resources

To complete this project, participants are encouraged to refer to the following resources:
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Immutable vs Mutable types](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747)
- [Understanding Python Objects](https://realpython.com/python-objects/)
- [Python Object Identity and Equality](https://towardsdatascience.com/object-equality-in-python-d4b0eb6b9d5e)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is advantageous
- Define what an object is in Python
- Differentiate between a class and an object (instance)
- Distinguish between mutable and immutable objects
- Understand references, assignment, and aliasing in Python
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
- Display variable identifiers (memory addresses) in Python
