## Concepts

For this project, you are expected to familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

- **Python programming**: Understanding the basics and syntax of Python.
- **Pycodestyle**: Adhering to Python's style guide to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo and project folder is mandatory.
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- Files must be executable.

### Shell Scripts

- Files will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Files should be exactly two lines long.
- Files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- Files must be executable.

### C Scripts

- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Files should end with a new line.
- Code should use the Betty style (checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`).
- No global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Tasks

### 0. Run Python file
Write a shell script that runs a Python script stored in the `$PYFILE` environment variable.

### 1. Run inline
Write a shell script that runs Python code stored in the `$PYCODE` environment variable.

### 2. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

### 3. Print integer
Complete a script to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

### 4. Print float
Complete a script to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

### 5. Print string
Complete a script to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

### 6. Play with strings
Complete a script to print `Welcome to Holberton School!` using variables `str1` and `str2`.

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
Complete a script that uses slicing to extract and manipulate parts of the variable `word`.

### 8. Create a new sentence
Complete a script to print `object-oriented programming with Python` without using string literals.

### 9. Easter Egg
Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python” by Tim Peters.

### 10. Linked list cycle
Write a function in C to check if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

## Usage
